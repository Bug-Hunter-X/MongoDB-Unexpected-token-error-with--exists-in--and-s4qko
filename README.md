# MongoDB Unexpected Token Error with $exists in $and
This repository demonstrates a common error encountered when using the `$exists` operator within an `$and` clause in a MongoDB aggregation query. The error typically manifests as an 'Unexpected token' error, often pointing to an issue with JSON parsing.

## Problem
The initial code attempts to find documents where both `field1` and `field2` exist.  However, due to an improper query construction (or related data issues), it fails, raising an 'Unexpected token' error, suggesting a problem in the query's JSON structure sent to the MongoDB server.

## Solution
The solution involves careful review of the query structure and data.  Additional checks, including those related to data type validation or ensuring the correct use of the `$exists` operator, may resolve the issue.
